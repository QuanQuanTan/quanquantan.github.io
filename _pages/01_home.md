# About me
I am a PhD student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) (NTU), Singapore under the supervision of Associate Professor [Thomas Peyrin](https://thomaspeyrin.github.io/web/). My research interests are in optimizing the implementations of block ciphers and the cryptanalysis of symmetric key block ciphers, in particularly, the applications of machine learning techniques on the cryptanalysis of block ciphers. Previously, I have also obtained Bachelor of Science (Honours) and Master of Science from NTU.
